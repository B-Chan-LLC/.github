# Introductions

Accepted offer into Carlson School of Management for Executes and then dropped out a week later. I'm at NYU now pursuing a masters in cybersecurity. The intention of this is to continuing partnering with the University of Minnesota through our group which disbanded since we left. I've only been in contact with Josh and Brady.
