# Summary

The intention of this group which whose intention is to form a separate entity if there's any traction is to continue partnering with the University of Minnesota through this group. This organization is one of many in order to work with the desired people despite differences in the merging of business. This in and of itself is a study for business schools.

# Background

Accepted offer into Carlson School of Management for Executes and then dropped out a week later. I'm at NYU now pursuing a masters in cybersecurity. I have a lot to do.
